/**
 * `scp federation import` — the receiving side of the `.scpbundle` file transport (DESIGN.md
 * §13). SECURITY-SENSITIVE (M6 PR body flag — every check here is fail-closed by construction:
 * an exception aborts the whole caller transaction, applying nothing):
 *
 *  1. Bundle-level: the payload must hash to the claimed `checksum`, and `checksum` must verify
 *     against the EXPORTING peer's Ed25519 public key (resolved at the historical point in time
 *     the bundle claims to have been exported, honoring key rotation).
 *  2. Chain-level: every entry from `cursor+1` onward must form a contiguous, correctly-signed
 *     hash chain continuing from the LAST entry this side actually applied (`sync_cursors`'
 *     `lastAppliedRowHash` — not just internal-to-this-bundle contiguity, which alone would let an
 *     attacker splice in a fabricated sub-chain at an arbitrary cursor). `verifyJournalChain`
 *     returning `valid: false` for ANY reason rejects the ENTIRE segment — no partial-prefix
 *     application.
 *  3. Row-level (graph/objects-repo.ts, graph/relationships-repo.ts): single-writer authority is
 *     re-checked on every individual write via `FederationImportContext` — a bundle cannot make
 *     this domain apply a write claiming authorship of an object it doesn't already know belongs
 *     to the SAME origin domain the bundle is nominally from.
 *
 * Import applies through the exact same repo functions the public API's write path uses
 * (`upsertObjectByUrn`, `createRelationship`, ...) — DESIGN §6: "a federation bundle import is
 * literally a replay of public-API writes that converges no matter how many times it is applied."
 * This is also why import can never bypass local RLS/RBAC/tenancy: it runs inside the SAME
 * `withTenantTx` as any other request, under the SAME `scp_app` role, so a bundle addressed to
 * org A can only ever write org A's rows — there is no cross-org code path here at all.

/**
 * Resolves an imported object's LOCAL containment placement (`objects.domain_id`) — a genuinely
 * separate concern from single-writer CONTENT authority (`originDomainId`), and one this
 * milestone's own two-domain E2E surfaced the hard way: `authz/resolve.ts`'s RBAC containment
 * walk assumes "every object's chain terminates at ITS OWN org's root" (that module's own doc
 * comment). Preserving a foreign domain's `domainId` verbatim breaks that assumption the moment
 * the referenced parent wasn't ALSO replicated (the common case — DESIGN §13 never requires
 * syncing an origin domain's own root/containment objects) — the replica becomes a syntactically
 * valid but UNREACHABLE-BY-RBAC row: no local role binding's containment walk can ever reach it,
 * so every authorized read/write against it fails closed with 403, forever.
 *
 * The fix: `domainId` is LOCAL PLACEMENT, not authority — DESIGN §13's single-writer authority
 * governs WHO may write a row, never WHERE it displays in a domain's own containment tree. So:
 * if the payload's claimed parent id already exists in THIS org (e.g. a nested hierarchy that WAS
 * fully replicated, parent-first, in this same import), preserve it — the nesting is genuinely
 * meaningful locally too. Otherwise (the common case), the replica is placed under THIS domain's
 * OWN org root instead (`undefined` — `graph/objects-repo.ts`'s existing default), which is
 * reachable by every role binding an operator normally holds. An explicit `null` (the origin's
 * own object WAS its org root) is preserved as `null` only when nothing else already exists at
 * that exact id locally, avoiding a collision with this domain's OWN, unrelated root object.
