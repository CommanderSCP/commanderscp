/**
 * The change lifecycle state machine (DESIGN.md §9.1) as DATA — a pure, exhaustively unit-tested
 * module with zero I/O, per BUILD_AND_TEST.md §4.1: "anything testable as a pure function must
 * be written as a pure function (the design's single guarded transition function... exist partly
 * for this)". `coordination/transition.ts`'s guarded transition function uses `isLegalTransition`
 * below as its legality gate — the SOLE runtime authority. (`drizzle/0007_change_coordination.sql`
 * — plus `0032_state_transitions_waiting.sql` for the M12 P4B `waiting` edges — also seeds a
 * `state_transitions` table. That table is still read by no runtime code, but it is now
 * seeded-and-checked: `transitions.integration.test.ts` asserts SET EQUALITY, both directions and
 * triggers included, between the DB rows and `LEGAL_TRANSITIONS`, so the two can never silently
 * drift again. `transitions.test.ts` separately cross-checks THIS constant against a hardcoded
 * edge set.)
 *
 * Edge rationale (DESIGN §9.1's diagram + prose):
 *  - The "happy path" states form a chain: proposed -> evaluated -> coordinated -> executing ->
 *    validating -> promoted. Each step corresponds to the engine's own observe/compare/decide/
 *    coordinate progression (coordination/reconcile.ts).
 *  - `waiting` (M12 P4B) is an OPTIONAL detour on the coordinated->executing step: a change with
 *    unsatisfied `properties.requires` goes coordinated -> waiting and is held there until every
 *    cross-change prerequisite is satisfied, then waiting -> executing. A change with no `requires`
 *    takes coordinated -> executing directly, exactly as before — both edges are legal. `cancel` is
 *    legal from `waiting` too (it is pre-promotion); `rollback` is not (nothing has executed yet).
 *  - `cancel` is legal from every pre-promotion state (proposed/evaluated/coordinated/executing/
 *    validating) — an operator can always abort a change that hasn't been promoted yet.
 *  - `rollback` is legal once the change has actually done something an external system needs
 *    reverting (executing/validating/promoted) — never from proposed/evaluated/coordinated, where
 *    nothing has executed yet and `cancel` is the correct verb.
 *  - `cancelled` and `rolled_back` are terminal EXCEPT `promoted -> rolled_back` (a promoted
 *    change can still be rolled back later) — every other state has no outgoing edges once
 *    reached.
